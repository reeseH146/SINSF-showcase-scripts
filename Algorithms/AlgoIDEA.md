# Sort
## Bubble
 - Program loops/passes through list of items
 - "bubbles" items larger than items before it past it, does not move it up if smaller. If equal to doesn't matter
 - Passes the list n times to ensure all items have been bubbled up

## Insertion
 - Starting on 2nd item, loop through list
 - If item is less than item before it loop backwards
 - Keep looping backwards and swapping the item with the item before it until it is greater than it
 - Return back to original position before looping backwards and continue until reaching end of list
